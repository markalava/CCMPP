Description: Implements the two-sex, female-dominant cohort-component
    method of population projection for populations (e.g., of
    humans). This is a deterministic method for projecting age-stratified
    population counts forward in time. Two versions are inlcuded: one in
    pure R and the other a wrapper for an implementation in C.
